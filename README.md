# BVN Values

This is a _super_ simple package that contains the specific colours and words. 

## installation

The package is [here on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/bvn_values/) and [here on github](https://github.com/bvn-architecture/py-brand).

```pip install bvn_values```

## Things you can do with this

There are currently only two things this can do:

* `company_name` is a function that gives you the name of the company.
* `get_bvn_brand_colours` is a function that returns a dictionary of brand colours. 

That's it! (for now)
